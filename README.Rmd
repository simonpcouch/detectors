# detectors

`detectors` is an R data package containing predictions from various GPT detectors. The data is based on the pre-print:

**GPT Detectors Are Biased Against Non-Native English Writers.**
*Weixin Liang*, *Mert Yuksekgonul*, *Yining Mao*, *Eric Wu*, *James Zou.*
arXiv: [2304.02819](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02819)

The study authors carried out a series of experiments passing a number of essays to different GPT detection models. Juxtaposing detector predictions for papers written by native and non-native English writers, the authors argue that GPT detectors disproportionately classify real writing from non-native English writers as AI-generated. 

## Installation

You can install the data package with the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
require(pak)
pak::pak("simonpcouch/detectors")
```

## Example

Taking a look at the data:

```{r}
